# Block2Project

## Overview
This repository contains code and supporting files for my **Block 2 Ethics and Technology Project** at the University of Utah.  
The project explores ethical decision-making, data collection, and the responsible use of artificial intelligence through practical coding exercises and written analyses.  

The repository may include:
- Example scripts demonstrating ethical frameworks in decision-making.
- Code used to model or visualize moral dilemmas or AI systems.
- Documentation connecting programming tasks to real-world ethical issues.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to share the technical components of my coursework while promoting open access and collaboration.  
All work here is made publicly available for educational and non-commercial use under the **MIT License**, encouraging others to learn from and adapt the material responsibly.
